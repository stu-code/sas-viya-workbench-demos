# SAS Viya Workbench Demos
---

This repository contains demos for specific industry use cases on SAS Viya Workbench. Demos are organised in different folders as per industry.

We hope these demos stimulate thoughts and ideas around possibilities with SAS Viya Workbench, a developer-oriented, scalable and performant analytics environment which increases  productivity.  This repository is also an ideal platform for you to showcase your demos (planned) and collaborate with like-minded creators.
