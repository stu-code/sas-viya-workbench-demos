# Synthetic Data Privacy Risk Evaluation with Anonymeter

## Introduction to Synthetic Data

Synthetic data is artificially generated data that replicates the statistical properties of real-world datasets maintaining the utility of data for analysis and innovation.

### Why does synthetic data matter?
Synthetic data solves the challenge of sharing and analyzing sensitive data in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. By substituting real data with synthetic counterparts, organizations can:

* Enable innovation while adhering to stringent data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
* Reduce risks of data breaches and re-identification of individuals.
* Facilitate cross-organization collaborations and open-data initiatives.

## Privacy Risks in Synthetic Data
It is essential to evaluate and quantify these risks to ensure robust data protection. Three primary types of privacy risks are associated with synthetic data:

### **1. Singling Out**
The ability to isolate an individual record within the synthetic dataset corresponding to a real-world individual in the original dataset. 

*"There is only one person with attributes X, Y, and Z"*

### **2. Linkability**
There is a risk that an attacker can link records between the synthetic dataset and other datasets (e.g., external data sources) to re-identify individuals.

*"Records A and B belong to the same person"*

### **3. Inference**
Definition: The risk that sensitive attributes of an individual can be inferred from synthetic data.

*"A person with attributes X and Y also have Z" (inference)*

## Privacy Risks Evaluation
This workbench demo demonstrates how to utilize the open-source Python library [Anonymeter](https://github.com/statice/anonymeter) to evaluate the different possible privacy risks. It includes in-depth explanations of the different risks, how the library evaluates the risk, and how to interpret the results. 

**Currently the demo notebook is only for Singling Out Risk. The other 2 will be added in the future.**

## Data
We shall be using data from the Adult Census Bureau database, made available  [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult) and released under license [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This data was extracted from the 1994 Census Bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics).

The notebook contains steps to pull the data.

## Pre-requisites
An Active SAS Viya Workbench license and environment.

Python packages required:

pmlb - used for fetching datasets from the Penn Machine Learning Benchmark.
anonymeter  - Open Source package to evaluate privacy risks of synthetic datasets

Package versions can be found in the [requirements.txt](./config/requirements.txt) file.

Install packages using the following command line command:

```
pip install -r config/requirements.txt
```

## Parameters

### Synthetic Data

This notebook does not generate the synthetic data from the dataset mentioned. It can be generated, using other methods such as this [SDM Notebook](/government/census-synthetic-data-generation/python/GMM_Adult_Census_Income_Data_Workbench.ipynb), or services like SAS Data Maker.

The notebook will contain comments on where to enter the file path to the synthetic data.

## Output
Various Evaluation Metrics and Plots to illustrate the privacy risk of the synthetic data set.
