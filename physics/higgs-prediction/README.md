This project explores how hyperparameter autotuning can give you an extra edge in predictive power. This is a great tool to have in your toolbox if to try and get that bit more of accuracy you may need, especially when every point makes a major difference. The goal: create a machine learning model to discriminate between Higgs Boson particles vs. background noise in particle collisions from the [Higgs Boson dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/280/higgs).

[Check out my blog about this project](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2025/06/13/boost-ml-accuracy-with-hyperparameter-tuning/) for all the details.

# Environment
